Fitness App and Wearables Till Now

1.	Wearable band track only health parameter and do not provide insight 

     -	Wearable Tech track user health data such as calorie burnt, spO2 , sleep ,etc.

     -	It doesnâ€™t provide the insight such as how much calorie should I burn to get fit or how much sleep should I get after the matchday or 
                is there anomaly in user health data

2.	No Platform to Connect with Sport Professional or Trainer

     -	If a user wants to share his health data insight there is no platform to share .

     -	User from outside area find it difficult to get help from better sport professional or Trainer

3.	Inefficient Technology to keep tab on health and Expensive

     -	Keeping tab on Health is expensive 

     -	Overall regime is very expensive
